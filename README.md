# Devanagari-word-recognition
This is a Word Recognition System which I developed for Devanagari Script. The learning model was trained on 92 thousand images (32x32 pixels) of 46 characters, consonants ka to gya and digits 0 to 9.

# Required Python modules
1.Tensorflow >= 2.0
2.Keras
3.OpenCV
4.Numpy
5.keras

# Files information
1.modelcode - used for final prediction of the model by uploading a clear image as shown in the file.
2.Training model - contains code for visualization and training of the the model.
3.palak3.jpeg - contains a sample image used for this project.


# Steps to run this example
1. Load the training model.ipynb and modelcode.ipynb into jupyter notebook using anaconda in your device.
2.
