# Devanagari-word-recognition
This is a Word Recognition System which I developed for Devanagari Script. The learning model was trained on 92 thousand images (32x32 pixels) of 46 characters, consonants ka to gya and digits 0 to 9.

# Required Python modules
1.Tensorflow >= 2.0
2.Keras
3.OpenCV
4.Numpy
5.keras

# Files information
1.modelcode - used for final prediction of the model by uploading a clear image as shown in the file.
2.Training model - contains code for visualization and training of the the model.
3.palak3.jpeg - contains a sample image used for this project.


# Steps to run this example
1. Load the Training model.ipynb and modelcode.ipynb into jupyter notebook using anaconda in your device.
2. Download the sample image palak3.jpeg into your device and correct the location of the image in modelcode.ipynb
3. Run each snippet of modelcode.ipynb this will predict the output of each characters of the word.
